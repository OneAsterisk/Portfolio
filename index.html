        I am a 3rd year Computer Science - Game Design major at
        <span class="MTU"><b class="bigletters">Michigan Tech</b></span
        >. I have been passionate about game design since I was quite young. I
        first started dabling with programming while I was in middle school. I
        got really into it in high school when I took my first game design
        class. In this class I learned C# and began using Unity. Using unity I
        created my first functional game which sadly I no longer have the source
        code for. Eventually this led me down the path to get more into
        programming and eventually pursue it as a career. This has brought me to
        the point where I have declared my major to be a game dev with a minor
        in cyber security
